      <p className="title-text">Francophiles will find much to love at Berkeleyâ€™s traditional creperie</p>
        <p className="name-text"> Shaojie Zhang<br /> December 4, 2023</p>
        <p className="main-text">In May 2020, amidst the challenging backdrop of the global pandemic, the owners of La Crepe a Moi, Rebecca and Dj Dahmani, fulfilled their dream by opening a brick-and-mortar establishment in Berkeley's Northside neighborhood. With a firm resolve, they are determined to persevere until the return of Cal students, upon whom much of their business relies. </p>
        <p className="main-text">The art of crepe-making at La Crepe a Moi is a captivating experience. Observing either Rebecca or Dj skillfully pour and spread the batter on the hot griddle is a mesmerizing process. The result is a perfect, golden-brown crepe, tantalizingly filled with ingredients like cheese, ham, or egg, and then expertly folded into a cone. The first bite reveals a delightful mix of textures and flavors, embodying the essence of French culinary tradition.</p>
        <p className="main-text">The couple's journey began in 2000 when Rebecca, a Francophile from Sonoma County working in Paris, met Dj, a French-Algerian with a passion for cooking. Dj's culinary journey started at 17, making crepes in Paris's vibrant La Villette. Over the years, he honed his skills in various Parisian eateries, including roles as a pastry chef and a sous chef in a renowned Moroccan restaurant. </p>
        <p className="main-text">In 2008, the couple relocated to Berkeley for their son's education at the Ecole Bilingue. After both worked at Eccolo, a well-respected Berkeley restaurant, they ventured into entrepreneurship. Launching La Crepe a Moi, they initially delighted festival and farmers market goers with their crepes, served under a distinctive blue and white tent.</p>
        <p className="main-text">However, the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent shelter-in-place order in March 2020 severely disrupted their plans. Just before their official opening, the final inspection was halted, and their presence in farmers markets, a crucial part of their business strategy, faced substantial challenges. With market closures and restrictions, their plan to distribute flyers and discounts was upended.</p>
        <p className="main-text">The Northside of the Cal campus, where their new establishment is located, was particularly affected, as reported by Berkeleyside. For Dj and Rebecca, the situation was exacerbated as La Crepe a Moi was still unknown, making a pivot to takeout a less viable option.Rebecca laments their current situation, operating at only 10% of their potential. Adapting their expectations and business growth plans has been a significant challenge. They had envisioned expanding their menu to include espresso, Belgian waffles, salads, and special cultural nights featuring Algerian and Moroccan cuisines, along with a grand opening celebration. These plans, however, are on hold as they navigate the uncertain landscape, waiting for the right moment to fully realize their vision.</p>
